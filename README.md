Last 10 Days on Earth

## Description

Last 10 Days on Earth is a first person shooting game set around a zombie apocalypse in which the player character is a survivor trying to get to a safe zone of other humans in 10 days before they transmigrate to Mars. In the final game, the player must plow through 9 levels of different environments filled with different objectives they must complete in order to reach the 10th and final level, the safe zone itself. However, for our prototype we have designed one level to showcase the core mechanics.

## Controls
W = Move Forwards
S = Move backwards
A = Move towards the left
D = Move towards the right
Space = Jump
Mouse movement = Aim
Mouse click = Shoot
R = Reload
Esc = Pause

## Objectives
1. You must collect 6 Key Items that are needed to clear the level, of which are marked with a green colour and randomly spawn every 5 seconds.
2. You must kill 6 enemies that will continue to follow you throughout the map until you deal enough damage to them with your gun. These enemies will randomly spawn every 10s.

## Other mechanics
1. If the player takes a hit from the enemy, they will first take damage towards their Armour (designated by the white bar in the player UI).
2. If the player's Armour is less than or equal to 0, they will start to take damage towards their Health (designated by the red bar in the player UI).
3. If the player's Health drops to 0, a game over message is displayed and the game resets, allowing them to try again.
4. If the player's Armour is less than the maximum, they can pick up Armour pickups (which are coloured blue).
5. If the player's Health is less than the maximum, they can pick up Health pickups (which are coloured red).
